# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
New Data Structure!
Hash Table is a data structure that is used to store key/value pairs! It uses a hash function to compute an index into a list where the element will be inserted or searched.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create your own new data structure: Hash Tables!
Cover it in tests and make sure it's all in working order for future use. 



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Hash Tables have a time/space complexity of O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
* Hash: Use the calculations to get the index where a key should be placed
* Set: Should hash the key value pair into the table handling collisions as needed
* Get: Return the value associated with the key
* Contains: Return a boolean if the key exists
* Keys: Return a set of the keys!
