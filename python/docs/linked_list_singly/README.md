## Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Our first introduction to the linked list implementation.

### Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class. Create a Linked List class. Allow for insertion into the Linked List
Then allow us to traverse and check in values are present within the linked list.

### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
This will be an O(1) because we are adding to the front of the list which means
no matter how many items are within the linked list it will be the same step to add one to the head
and creating a next link to the previous head.

### API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
Methods are Include and insert into a linked list

### References
We ran through this lab during lecture with JB so this code is very similar to JBs code!
I wrote it out myself to demonstrate understanding and added comments
Comments are meant to show that I understand what each line/method within the code is doing.

I also used [This Handy Link](https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-format-a-string-that-contains-curly-braces-in-python/)
for the dunder string method because the output asks for the { } in the output of each nodes value
Found that the double {{ and }} will escape and keep the inner ones I've typed!

All jokes aside Python is pretty dang neat.
